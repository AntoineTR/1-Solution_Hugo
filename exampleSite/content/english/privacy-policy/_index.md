#### Integrity

Integrity is defined as the “state of being complete or undivided[\[1\]](#_ftn1).” This also describes our value system and work ethic. We walk the talk and put our words into action.

#### Creativity

Preconceived notions and doctrine hinder the development and visioning of creative, innovative, and effective solutions. This is why we choose to approach every situation with fresh eyes and by thinking outside of the box. As a result, 1-SOLUTION is _your_ unique and tailored solution. In other words, what _you_ really need.

#### Human

To ensure the success and effectiveness of any change, the key actors in your business need to be involved early and throughout. At the heart of your organization are your people. We are experienced communicators, eager to hear their challenges and experiences, and to understand the impacts of potential changes. This is also why we put an emphasis on offering trainings that minimize stress and maximize adoption of new solutions and ways of working.
